//! FSRS-based spaced-repetition scheduling over Anki's 4-button grading.
//! Pure and persistence-agnostic: callers own turning `interval_days` into
//! an actual due timestamp and storing it.
//!
//! Short relearning steps (a failed card coming back within the same
//! session rather than a full day out) aren't something FSRS itself models
//! — Anki layers them on top of its own FSRS scheduling the same way this
//! does: on `Again`, FSRS still updates `stability`/`difficulty` to reflect
//! the lapse, but the actual next-due interval is overridden with a short
//! fixed step instead of FSRS's own (much longer) suggested interval.
