# Host-level tooling this project needs on macOS, installed with:
#   brew bundle install
#
# This is the bootstrap layer only. Once these are installed, `nix develop`
# provides the actual Rust toolchain and build tools (see flake.nix) — don't
# duplicate those here.
#
# Rust itself is managed by rustup + rust-toolchain.toml, not Homebrew:
# install rustup from https://rustup.rs (or `brew install rustup-init` then
# run `rustup-init`) rather than Homebrew's standalone `rust` formula, which
# doesn't respect this repo's toolchain file.
#
# Nix (for `nix develop`) isn't installed via Homebrew either — it needs its
# own installer for the dedicated volume + daemon setup on macOS.
# See https://nixos.org/download.
